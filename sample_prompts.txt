# Prompt 1: Creative Generation (Should trigger clarifying questions)
Write a short, futuristic story for a young adult audience about a teenager who discovers an AI that can dream. The story should have a hopeful tone and be around 500 words.

# Prompt 2: Technical Generation (Should trigger clarifying questions)
Create a Python function named `calculate_ema` that calculates the Exponential Moving Average of a list of numbers. The function should take two arguments: a list of prices and a `span` (integer). It must include type hints, a docstring explaining its usage, and handle potential errors like an empty input list.

# Prompt 3: Technical Analysis (Should trigger light refinement)
I have a Python script that is running slower than expected. Here is the main function:
```python
def process_data(data_list):
    results = []
    for item in data_list:
        # Simulate a complex, slow operation
        processed_item = item * item
        time.sleep(0.1)
        results.append(processed_item)
    return results
```
Analyze this code for performance bottlenecks and suggest specific optimizations.

# Prompt 4: Conceptual Analysis (Should trigger light refinement)
Compare and contrast the architectural patterns of microservices and a monolithic backend. Focus on scalability, development speed, and operational complexity.

# Prompt 5: Ambiguous / Simple (Should trigger clarifying questions)
Social media post about AI.
